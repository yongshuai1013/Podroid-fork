 * [state] to Running when "Ready!" appears. Each feed scans the newly-appended
 * region plus a short overlap carried from the previous feed, so a marker that
 * straddles a read boundary — or sits early in a single oversized chunk — is
 * still caught (see the history of detectBootStage in PodroidQemu pre-refactor).
 * One-shot: stops scanning after the first "Ready!" to keep [onReady] idempotent.
